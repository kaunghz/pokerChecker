I play poker for fun. This is a C++ Poker checker program to check the highest set given a set of cards. The order follows:
1. Check for a full house.
2. Check for a flush.
3. Check for a straight.
4. Check for three of a kind.
5. Check for two pair.
6. Check for one pair.
7. Check for a high card.

I know there are Royal flush, Straight flush, four of a kind. We can easily write logics to add these, but for simplicity, this program checks the 7 by order, then return the highest set. There is also testsuite to check for test cases with different cases.
